# Elisp Interface to IPFS daemon HTTP Protocol

A few experiments interfacing with an IPFS daemon over its HTTP
protocol. We just want a few calls from
https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/dht really.

## Application Thoughts

One application might include stuctured programming by storing either
bytecode or lisp as content addressable objects. My term for this is
the old ClearCase term of "wink-in", or derived object, storage.

Another can be an IPFS elpa/melpa package implementation. Package
managers are a current focus of the IPFS team, which it's especially
well suited for.
